preparation:
    body: 
      - Rinse and drain the beans. Peel and halve the shallots, carrots. Peel and smash the garlic. Cut celery into 3 inch lengths. You may want to tie up or bind the aromatcis together. Depending on taste you'll want to remove them from the final product.

    title: Prepare the beans
    body: Put the beans in a large heavy pot and cover them by about an inch with cold water. Bring the water to a boil over high heat. Let the beans boil for one minute, then remove them from the heat and cover the pot. Set aside for one hour.

    title: Start the broth
    body: Put the beans in a large heavy pot and cover them by about an inch with cold water. Bring the water to a boil over high heat. Let the beans boil for one minute, then remove them from the heat and cover the pot. Set aside for one hour. Drain the beans and return them to the pot. Add the chicken stock, and if the beans aren't quite covered in liquid, add a little bit of water. Add the shallots, garlic, celery, carrot, scallions, thyme, rosemary, Parmesan rind, olive oil and a teaspoon of salt. Bring to a boil, then lower the heat until the beans are just simmering. Cook uncovered for about 40 minutes, until the beans are almost tender. Add the tomatoes and cook gently for another 10 to 20 minutes.

    title: Finish dish
    body: Remove the aromatics and extra vegetables if you like (or save them for yourself like I do), taste and add more salt if necessary. Serve drizzled with a little olive oil and a shower of Parmesan.
