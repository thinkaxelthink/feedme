You might have to refill the steaming water in your pot (just keep an eye on the water level).", "Let potatoes cool and process through a potato ricer.", "Stir in the butter and season with salt. Taste and adjust with additional salt and/or butter if needed. If the mashed potatoes isn't quite creamy enough, add more butter. Sprinkle fresh minced chives on top."]
